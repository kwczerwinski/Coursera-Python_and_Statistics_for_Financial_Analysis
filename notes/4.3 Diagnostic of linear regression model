# Validating assumptions for linear regression model
# Io other words - demonstrate that sample data is not against assumptions
# Linearity - make scatter plot to show it exists or not
# Independent - observed error is independent mutually, in other words, no serial correlation in errors
# - make plot of errors (differences) between real results and response, and try to find a pattern
# <data>['error'] = <data>['<responce>'] - <data>['BestResponse']
# - Durbin-Watson test - visible in model.summary(), always [0, 4],
#   0 is strong positive autocorrelation, 4 is strong negative autocorrelation, 2 is no autocorrelation
# Normality - use quantile-quantile (QQ) plot
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# z = (<data error> - <data error>.mean()) / <data error>.std(ddof=1)  # TODO: shouldn't be 2?
# stats.probplot(z, dist="norm", plot=plt)
# plt.show()
# plot should be a line, and around it should be scattered points that follows that line
# Equal variance - plot error vs predictor
# <data>.plot(kind='scatter', x='<responce>', y='error')
# try to find pattern, like smaller variance at the end of plot

# If at least one assumption is violated, then cannot make statistical inference,
# however model accuracy and consistency doesn't rely on assumptions and still can be used.
