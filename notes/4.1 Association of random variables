# Linear pattern

# Quantifying association with covariance
# Population: Cov(X,Y) = (sum((X_i - mu_X) * (Y_i - mu_Y)) / N
# Sample: Cov(X,Y) = (sum((X_i - X_bar) * (Y_i - Y_bar)) / (n - 1)
# DataFrame's method for showing covariance .cov()
# Covariance is affected by variance of two random variables.

# Coefficient of correlation (CoC)
# Population: ro(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y) / (sigma_X * sigma_Y)
# Sample: r(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y) / (s_X * s_Y)
# CoC always between -1 and 1.
# DataFrame's method for showing CoC .corr()
